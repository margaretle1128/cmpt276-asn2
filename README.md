# Student Tracker Web Application

This is a web application called "Student Tracker" that allows you to manage student information. It is built using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Java SpringBoot, and is deployed on Render.com.

## Main Page

The main page of the application is located at `/students/view`. On this page, each student is represented by a box, and the dimensions of the box are proportional to the student's weight and height.

To delete a student, simply click the "Ã—" button in the top right corner of the student's box. A confirmation prompt will appear, and upon confirmation, the student will be removed from the system.

To add a new student, click the "+" button in the bottom left corner of the main page. This will open a form where you can enter the student's information. Fill in the required fields and click "Add" to save the student's information. You will then be redirected back to the main page, and the new student's information will be displayed.

If you decide to cancel adding a new student or editing an existing student's information, you can choose the "Main Page" option in the top left corner of the page. This will take you back to the main page without saving any changes.

## Editing Student Information

To edit a student's information, simply click directly on the student's name. This will open a form pre-filled with the student's current information. Make the necessary changes and click "Save" to update the student's details. The updated information will be displayed on the main page.

If you decide to cancel the editing process, you can choose the "Main Page" option in the top left corner of the page to go back without saving any changes.

That's it! You are now ready to use the Student Tracker web application to manage and track student information effectively.
